Node uses commonJS

HelpFul globals in nodejs but just like browsers dont create them.

1. process: has info about the environment the program is running in 
2. require: function to find and use modules in current module 
3. __dirname: the current directory path 
4. module: information  about current module, methods for making modules consumable 
5. global: like window, its the global object. NEVER Use them 

and there are more like __filename
